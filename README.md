- 👋 Hi, I’m @BDOGDU
- 👀 I’m interested in composition engineering with basic ANN algorithm.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MLP application for %element fractions as input parameter, mechanical test results of tensile test specimen (%elongation,yield strength and tensile strength)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on those who have knowledge about implementation of MLP coding on python for my M.Sc. thesis.
- 📫 You can reach me on my work mail adress : [bdogdu@cms.com.tr](url)
